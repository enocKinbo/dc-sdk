# Trane TRACE 700: A Powerful Tool for HVAC System Design and Analysis
 
Trane TRACE 700 is a software application that helps engineers and designers to create, simulate and optimize HVAC systems for various building types and scenarios. It allows users to compare the energy and economic performance of different system configurations, evaluate the impact of design changes, and generate detailed reports and documentation.

Trane TRACE 700 is based on the ASHRAE Standard 90.1 and supports various energy codes and standards, such as LEED, Energy Star, EPAct and more. It can model complex systems with multiple chillers, boilers, fans, pumps, coils, heat recovery devices, thermal storage tanks and other components. It can also account for various factors that affect the system performance, such as weather data, occupancy schedules, load profiles, control strategies and utility rates.
 
Trane TRACE 700 is one of the most widely used HVAC design tools in the industry, with over 20 years of history and development. However, Trane has recently announced that it will sunset the TRACE 700 family of products as customers migrate to the updated technology platform TRACE 3D Plus[^2^]. TRACE 3D Plus is a cloud-based application that offers more features, flexibility and accuracy than TRACE 700. It also has a modern user interface and a faster calculation engine.

In this article, we will provide a brief overview of how to use Trane TRACE 700 to design and analyze a HVAC system for a typical office building. We will also compare the results with those obtained from TRACE 3D Plus and highlight the differences and similarities between the two software applications.
 
The office building we will use as an example has a floor area of 10,000 square feet and is located in Seattle, Washington. It has four floors and each floor has four zones with different orientations and loads. The building operates from 8 am to 6 pm on weekdays and is unoccupied on weekends and holidays. The design outdoor conditions are 95Â°F dry bulb and 75Â°F wet bulb for cooling and 25Â°F dry bulb and 15Â°F wet bulb for heating.
 
We will assume that the building has a variable air volume (VAV) system with a single air handling unit (AHU) that serves all zones. The AHU has a supply fan, a return fan, a cooling coil, a heating coil and an economizer. The cooling coil is connected to a water-cooled chiller that uses a cooling tower for heat rejection. The heating coil is connected to a gas-fired boiler that provides hot water. The VAV boxes have reheat coils that are also connected to the boiler.
 
To model this system in TRACE 700, we need to follow these steps:
 
1. Create a new project and enter the project information, such as name, location, weather data, utility rates and energy code.
2. Create the building geometry and define the zones, floors, walls, windows, roofs and other envelope components.
3. Assign the internal loads, such as lighting, equipment and occupancy, to each zone and specify the schedules and diversity factors.
4. Create the HVAC system and define the components, such as AHU, chiller, boiler, cooling tower, VAV boxes and reheat coils.
5. Assign the HVAC system to the zones and specify the design parameters, such as supply air temperature, airflow rate, fan pressure drop and control strategy.
6. Run the simulation and view the results in various formats, such as graphs, tables and reports.
